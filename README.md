#Daily Med, just another meditation app

######(A work in progress, built with React)

#####The purpose of this app is to allow users to submit mp3 files of "mini-meditations" that can be combined to create customized meditation sessions. The goal is for users to be able to explore different meditation techniques, and create a daily practice that works for them. 

####To do (not necessarily in order):

1. Build Node.js server and database (probably go with PostgreSQL)
2. Allow uploading of mp3 files
3. Figure out how to combine mp3 files to play seamlessly
4. Add third-party authentication
5. Build UI--for MVP, create a simple table with info and actions
6. Build method for combining files and saving as new session
